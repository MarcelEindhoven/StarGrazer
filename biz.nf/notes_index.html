  <h1>Design</h1>
    <h2>Design goals</h2>
      Software components should be portable whenever possible. So independent from a particular cloud, databae or other technology. I have seen so much waste when companies are forced to switch to a new technology while their software was entangled with existing, obolete software, os, external libraries, hardware.</p>
    <h2>Layering</h2>
      Front layer is in html with javascript.</p>
      REST communication has proven itself on the laptop and makes the front-end independent from which cloud/laptop is used.
      REST is implemented in the server communication layer.</p>
      Logic layer contains gaming logic and cross-player decisions. For simple CRUD operations the logical layer is skipped.</p>
      Database layer records all decisions. The database allows players to reenter a game and to replay game-instances for regression testing and trouble shooting.</p>
