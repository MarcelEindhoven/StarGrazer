  <h1>System context</h1>
  A player starts or joins a game and submits moves. The game keeps the player updated with real-time events.</p>

  <h1>Design</h1>
    <h2>Design goals</h2>
	  <h3>Portability</h3>
      Software components should be portable whenever possible. So independent from a particular cloud, databae or other technology. 
	  Much waste occurs when companies are forced to switch to a new technology while their software was entangled with existing, obolete software, os, external libraries, hardware.</p>
	  <h2>Frameworks</h2>
		<h3> NodeJS plus JavaScript </h3>
		The most simple server side implementation is used for user CRUD
		<h3> HTML plus JavaScript </h3>
		The most simple client side implementation is used for user CRUD.
		<h3> Express </h3>
		Also based on NodeJS plus JavaScript, Express makes implementation of game CRUD simpler by taking care of URL routing and parameter parsing.
		<h3> Angular </h3>
		To be implemented for client side game CRUD.
    <h2>Layering</h2>
      Front layer is initially in html with javascript. Later frameworks will be added. In this way both local level and high level experience is gained.</p>
      REST communication makes the front-end less dependent on which server is used.
      REST is implemented in the server communication layer.</p>
      Logic layer contains gaming logic and cross-player decisions. For simple CRUD operations the logical layer is skipped.</p>
      Database layer records all decisions. The database allows players to reenter a game and to replay game-instances for regression testing and trouble shooting.</p>
